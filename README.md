## Technology Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## User Stories:
- As a prospective customer of Jahdai’s services, I want to see examples of her work to determine if it aligns with my own website's needs, so - that I can make an informed decision to hire her. I am looking for good design, colors, and creativity.

- As a friend of Jahdai, I want to see what she’s learning in boot camp and cheer her on whenever she feels discouraged.

- As a senior engineer and mentor to Jahdai, I want to understand her engineering style, decision-making process, and provide feedback on what she does well and areas for improvement.

## Major Hurdles:
- I faced challenges primarily with responsive design and the principles of flexboxes. Often, I believed I had structured my HTML to create the proper containers for my elements to be positioned as I designed, but it did not work out. It was frequently challenging to determine which units to use (px, em, vw, etc.).

## Next Steps:
- I want to elevate the design, create a page for my art work and add animations.
